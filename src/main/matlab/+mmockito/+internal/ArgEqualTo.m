classdef ArgEqualTo < Matcher
    %ArgEqualTo is an internal matcher used to match constants.
    %   If constants are passed to be matched, they need to be converted to
    %   a Matcher. The robust solution would be to reuse the IsEqualTo
    %   constraint from the new matlab.unittest module, but it is not
    %   available in earlier MATLAB versions. In those cases, fallback to a
    %   simpler Matcher which works only with primitive types.
    
    %   Implemented as a try/catch rather than a version check because the
    %   former is much faster; using a version check in both methods
    %   approximately tripled the test time.
